# base layer

This is a shared codebase that I have developed along the time. It acts like a better libc (even though it depedens on libc), contains code for common data structures, utilities, and more.

The code contained here can and will change over time. There's no stable API, so if you are willing to use this, it's recommended to just copy the source files to your own source tree.
